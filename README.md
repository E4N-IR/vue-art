## Description
**@e4n/vue-art** is a smart CLI tool that helps developers initialize Vue-based projects with the right architecture from day one.  

Unlike a regular boilerplate generator, @e4n/vue-art asks interactive questions about:

- Framework choice (Vue 3, Nuxt 3, Vue + Vuetify)  
- Project scale (small, medium, large)  
- Project lifetime (short-term, long-term)  
- Features and state management (Pinia, Vuex, etc.)  

Based on your answers, it **recommends the most suitable project architecture** and automatically injects the **latest versions of selected npm packages** into `package.json`.  

This ensures your project starts clean, scalable, and avoids over-engineering.
